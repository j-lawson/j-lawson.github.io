I'm a biomedical data scientist who applies bioinformatics and data science approaches to understand gene regulation. Currently, I'm working on my PhD with [Dr. Nathan Sheffield at the University of Virginia](http://databio.org/) where I am creating novel computational methods to understand gene regulation and applying them in the context of cancer epigenetics.

### Experience

[Curriculum Vitae (CV)](./docs/Lawson_CV_website.pdf)

Check out some of my work:

- [COCOA](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/COCOA.html): An R/Bioconductor package that uses covariation of epigenetic signals across individuals to annotate interindividual epigenetic variation
- [MIRA](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MIRA.html): An R/Bioconductor package that aggregates DNA methylation in related loci across the genome to infer regulatory information
