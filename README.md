I'm a biomedical data scientist who applies bioinformatics and data science approaches to understand gene regulation. Currently, I'm working on my PhD with [Dr. Nathan Sheffield at the University of Virginia](http://databio.org/) where I am creating novel computational methods to understand gene regulation and applying them in the context of cancer epigenetics.

### Experience
